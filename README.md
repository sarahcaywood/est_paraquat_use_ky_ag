### Project Description

<p>The map "Kentucky Estimated Annual Paraquat Use, 2013 & 2017" was created to visualize the change in annual use of the pesticide Paraquat in Kentucky. 

<p>The available dataset from USGS included an extensive list of estimated annual pesticides used in agriculture in the US from 2013-2017. The pesticide Paraquat was selected from this list because it is one of the mostly used pesticides/ herbicides in the US, even though it is a "restricted use pesticide" determined by the EPA and is not available for residential use.  Paraquat poisoning can be fatal when consumed by humans and posses an ecological health risk to mammals, birds. invertebrates, plants and algae. Years 2013 and 2017 were selected for mapping visualization due to the data available and time limitations, as well as to show how Paraquat usage changed over 4 years in Kentucky. 

<p> Mapping skills utlized in this project included researching, evaluating, and filtering large datasets; joining attribute tables to add geometry to a text file; using the field calculator and the Ipad(string, width, fill) expression to convert data; map formating and styling; manual classification graduated symbology classificaiton using Equal Count (Quantile) and Natural Breaks (Jenks) as references; creating and formating map layout; and summary statistics for basic data analysis. 

<p>The visualization of this data shows how Paraquat usage had changed in 4 years. In 2013, a total 122,702 kg of Paraquat was estimated to be used in Kentucky, In 2017, the estimated total of Paraquat use reduced by 55% to 67,567 kg that year. In 2013, 4 counties (Simpson, Todd, Logan, and Christain) used over 7,000 kg of Paraquat individually, with Logan and Christian County using 12,763 kg and 15,919 kg, respectivelly. By 2017, there were no counties using Paraquat at this quantity, with the most being Christian County using 6,376 kg. Visually, both maps of Paraquat usage reflect the heavy agriculture presence in western Kentucky, but is worth noting that Paraquat usage increased from 2013 to 2017 in multiple counties in eastern Kentucky.
